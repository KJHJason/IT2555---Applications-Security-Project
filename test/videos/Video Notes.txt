ffmpeg groups the following extensions together:
- mkv, webm
- mov, mp4, m4a, 3gp, 3g2, mj2

These files are considered seperate, for reasons unknown.
- wmv, asf
- avchd, mts
- avi
- flv (Not detected as video on Windows, though can be run)

Addendum 1:
- mp4 as py (Success)
- gif (Converted, failed to play)
- avi as exe (Success)
- py as mp4 (Failed)

It appears ffmpeg does not identify the file by its extension.

This means exe files with valid video extensions are unlikely to parsed.


Addendum 2:
- jfif as mp4 (Failed resolution checking phase)

Image files acting as video files appear to 'confuse' ffmpeg.
