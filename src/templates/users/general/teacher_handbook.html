        CourseFinity is the global online learning platform that offers anyone, anywhere access to online
        courses and degrees from world-class universities and companies.
    </p>
    <p>
        CourseFinity is established and developed to meet the increasing need and demand for high quality education for
        everyone.

    </p>

    <h5>At CourseFinity we endeavour:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>To create an atmosphere of co-operation.</li>
        <li>We make use of the learners' available knowledge to move forward and obtain new knowledge.</li>
        <li>The knowledge we impart to our learners is relevant and pertains to their everyday life.</li>
        <li>
            Interaction takes place by trying to understand the learners' questions, reasoning, investigation and
            research.
        </li>
        <li>Learners are taught to think and to solve problems: how to reason and how to find creative solutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Teacher Who Serve With Dignity and Distinction</h3>
    <h5>Excellence is the key concept undergirding CourseFinity's mission and purposes.</h5>
    <p>
        Essentially, however, professional growth and development should arise from a personal motivation and striving
        towards
        excellence. With this in mind each educator is requested to regularly review his/her own professional
        development,
        using
        the following questions:
    </p>

    <h5>Professional expertise</h5>
    <p>
        Are my teaching and other aspects of my work soundly based on the latest knowledge and research in education,
        e.g.
        educational psychology, educational technology, curriculum development, methodology? Or are my actions based on
        “gut
        feeling”, ad hoc approaches, and perpetuating the ways in which I was taught twenty or thirty years ago? (What
        would
        you
        expect of a doctor?)
    </p>

    <h5>Professional performance</h5>
    <p>
        Am I consistently giving of my best and avoiding the “creeping slackness” that working behind closed doors for
        much
        of
        the time can encourage? Is my performance as an educator characterized by a high standard of planning and
        preparation,
        thoughtful choice of priorities, a balanced and objective approach, and stimulating and enthusiastic commitment?
    </p>

    <h5>Professional service</h5>
    <p>
        How interested am I in the development of each student? What actions demonstrate my interest and
        concern? How well do I know my learners and their individual needs? How do I react to learners who are
        uninterested,
        unmotivated, unpleasant or untalented?
    </p>


    <h5>Professional development</h5>
    <p>
        What am I doing of my own accord to improve my expertise and skills, without waiting for or relying completely
        on my
        employer to do this? What things show that I am not stagnating?
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>.png</li>
        <li>.jpg, .jpeg, .jfif</li>
    </ul>



    <h3>Include an Introduction Section</h3>
    <p>
        It is advised that you take a short moment to introduce about yourself and what you do for a living.
    </p>

    <h3>Include Well-Organized Video Content</h3>
    <p>
        Great instruction requires a solid structure based upon a lesson plan or course outline. At a minimum:
    <ul>
        <li>Each section of your video should highlighted at the start of the video as table of contents.</li>
        <li>For videos that needs to be separated to different courses, please use the same course title with a #number to indicate the part number of the course.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Meet Standards for Audio & Video Quality</h3>
    <p>
        High-quality audio and video ensures students can stay focused on learning. Keep in mind:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The audio in your class must be clear and easy to understand. It should also be free of distracting background noises, such as hums, fuzziness, crackling, or echoes.
        </li>
        <li>Your audio should sync with your video footage and come out of both channels.</li>
        <li>
            Your video (if applicable) must be high resolution (1080p) and shot with a steady camera, clear lighting, and framing.
        </li>
        <li>Screencasts, images, and text must be sharp, not blurry or pixelated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vary Visual Presentation</h3>
    <p>
        We require that teachers include a variety of visuals and/or visual formats, such as adding in on-screen text, slides, or example images, help emphasize key takeaways or explain complex ideas. Even switching up camera angles can break up static shots and keep students engaged. Classes should not showcase one static picture or slide for the entirety of a lesson.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to varied visuals, within each class:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Talking head shots need to be well-lit with professional backdrops.</li>
        <li>Slides need to be well-structured and visually appealing.</li>
        <li>Avoid rambling, ums, or excessive pauses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Limit Self-Promotion</h3>
    <p>
        Teaching on CourseFinity is a great way to grow your brand and build your audience. As long as your activities remain aligned with our Community Guidelines, Teaching Policies, and Terms of Service, we encourage you to engage with your followers regularly and link to your website and social media accounts from your CourseFinity profile.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within your classes though, marketing of your brand must be limited so that students can stay focused on learning. To that end, self-promotion within your classes (e.g., discussing your personal brand or business; encouraging students to follow you on social media or visit your website; sharing logos or other personal branding) should only happen within your introduction and conclusion videos.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are permitted to refer to any of your previous CourseFinity classes anywhere within a class as long as the reference is in support of student learning (e.g., it provides prerequisite information or complements your teaching in the current lesson).
    </p>

    <h3>Foster Genuine Learning</h3>
    <p>
        We support authentic, inspired learning and all classes on CourseFinity are, first and foremost, educational.
        Therefore:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Classes may not consist simply of a walkthrough, review, or demo of a certain website or tool without any added knowledge-based value from the teacher.
        </li>
        <li>
            We don't permit classes that guarantee or promise a specific outcome or are geared primarily towards helping students achieve a static or monetary reward (i.e., “get rich quick” schemes) or a follower count on a platform (i.e., “hacks” for growing your Instagram audience).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Share Unique Educational Value</h3>
    <p>
        CourseFinity values creativity, original thought, and teachers bringing their unique perspectives to their class topics. Keep in mind that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Your video lessons should include narration throughout as you impart your expertise through tips, best practices, frameworks, concepts, theory, and/or examples that are your own. Your personal knowledge, experience, and insight are the most valuable things you have to share!
        </li>
        <li>
            Classes may not draw from external materials that did not originate with the teacher for a significant portion of the class.
        </li>
        <li>Classes should be made for CourseFinity, and not branded for any other online teaching platforms.</li>
    </ul>
